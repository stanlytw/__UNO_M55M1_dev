/*
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
 pin 13, when mercury tilt switch is on.


 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground
 * mercury tilt switch attached to pin 2 from +5V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

// variables will change:
