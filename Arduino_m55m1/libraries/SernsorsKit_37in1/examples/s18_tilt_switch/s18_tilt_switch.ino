/*

 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital  
 pin 13, when the tilt switch closed. 
 
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground 
 * tilt switch attached to pin 2 from +5V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
 
 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

// variables will change:

  // check if the tilt switch is pressed.
  // if it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
