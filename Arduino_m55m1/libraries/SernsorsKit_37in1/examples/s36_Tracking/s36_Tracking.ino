/*
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
 pin 13, when tracking sensor sense the obstacle.


 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground
 * tracking sensor output(DO) attached to pin 10

 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

// variables will change:
int sensorState = 0;         // variable for reading the tracking sensor status

    // if it is, the sensorState is HIGH:
