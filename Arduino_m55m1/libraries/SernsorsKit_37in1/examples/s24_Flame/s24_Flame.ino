/*
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
 pin 13, when the flame sensor output HIGH.


 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground
 * flame sensor attached to pin 2 from +5V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.
