/*
  High sensitive voice
 
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital  
 pin 13, when the voice sensor attached to pin 10 sense the output. 
 
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground 
 * voice sensor output(DO) attached to pin 10
 
 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

  // check if the voice sensor is pressed.
  // if it is, the voiceSensorState is HIGH:
