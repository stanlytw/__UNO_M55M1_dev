/*
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital  
 pin 13, when the reed switch output HIGH. 
 
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground 
 * reed switch attached to pin 10 from DO
 
 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

// variables will change:
int switchState = 0;         // variable for reading the reed switch status

  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);

  // check if the reed switch is pressed.
  // if it is, the switchState is HIGH:
